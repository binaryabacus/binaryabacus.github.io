One of the most heated debate in Hong Kong is the 2017 political reform proposal. [Over half a million of protesters rallied](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-28102644) on the 17th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong to China. The protesters called for fairer and more open election for the city's Chief Executive as the head of the Hong Kong government.

Under the current election system, only the members of a 1200-people Election Committee are able directly cast votes for the Chief Executive. The commitee is formed by an election of 249,499 out of all 3.5 million registered voters. These eligible voters are then divided into 4 unequal voting sector to select 300 Election Committee members for each sector.

This system is regarded as unfair because of 2 reasons. Firstly, the other non-eligible 3.2 million voters have no voting right for the Election Committee whatsoever. Secondly, because the voting sectors are unequal, some sectors have more people competing for the same position than the other sectors.

As you will see in the following visualization, the voting power varies hugely (from 0x to 2800x) depending on who you are.

[Critics](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1297331/hong-kong-business-leaders-fear-political-strife-could-hold-city-back) have attributed to the current political gridlock to the unfairness in the election system, and the illegitimacy of the current Chief Executive. Many [political parties](http://www.dphk.org/index.php?route=news/press_releases&id=1593) and [think tanks](http://hongkong2020.com/2014/03/20/hong-kong-2020-preliminary-proposals-on-methods-for-selecting-the-chief-executive-in-2017-and-for-forming-the-legislative-council-in-2016/) have hoped that the 2017 political reform will result in a fairer election system with universal suffrage, which will resolve the gridlock.

At the same time, the Chinese Central Government had been emphasizing its "comprehensive jurisdiction" over Hong Kong through a ["white paper"](http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1529167/full-text-practice-one-country-two-systems-policy-hong-kong-special). The Hong Kong Bar Association deemed the white paper to [violate the Basic Law](http://www.hkba.org/whatsnew/misc/White_Paper_Response_eng.pdf), Hong Kong's mini constitution written by China and United Kingdom back in 1980s. In various press conferences, officials of the Chinese Government have suggested that all candidates will be preselected by a pro-Beijing nomination committee to disqualify potential candidates who do not ["love the country and love Hong Kong"](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2013/03/26/hong-kongs-future-leader-must-love-china/).
